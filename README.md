# Pronounify

## What does this even do?
Pronounify displays the pronouns for players registered on [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/)

## How can I show my pronouns?
Link your Minecraft account to your [PronounDB](https://pronoundb.org/) account (create one if you don't have one). This requires Microsoft account migration.
